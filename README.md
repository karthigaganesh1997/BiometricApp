# Biometric Authentication App *Overview* This Android app utilizes biometric authentication to provide a secure and seamless user experience. The app employs a combination of strong and weak biometric patterns to ensure robust security. Built using MVVM architecture, Jetpack Compose, and Android's biometric authentication API, this app demonstrates a cutting-edge approach to user authentication.
*Features* 
1. *Strong Biometric Pattern*: Utilizes Android's BiometricManager to authenticate users using fingerprint, face, or iris recognition.
2. *Weak Biometric Pattern*: Employs a custom-designed pattern recognition system for users who do not have access to strong biometric hardware.
3. *MVVM Architecture*: Built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to ensure separation of concerns and a maintainable codebase.
4. *Jetpack Compose*: Leverages Jetpack Compose to create a modern, responsive, and efficient user interface.
5. *Permission Handling*: Handles Android permissions for accessing device biometric data, ensuring transparency and user control.
6. *Encryption and Cryptography*: Employs advanced encryption and cryptography techniques to securely store biometric details, ensuring the protection of sensitive user data.
*Encryption and Cryptography Details*
1. *Encryption Algorithm*: Utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt biometric data.
2. *Key Management*: Employs a secure key management system to generate, store, and manage encryption keys.
3. *Cryptography Library*: Leverages the AndroidKeyStore and javax.crypto libraries to provide a secure and efficient cryptography solution.
 *Technical Details*
1. *Biometric Authentication API*: Utilizes Android's BiometricManager API to interact with device biometric hardware.
2. *Custom Pattern Recognition*: Employs a custom-designed pattern recognition algorithm for weak biometric pattern authentication.
3. *Data Storage*: Stores user biometric data securely using Android's Keystore API. *Screenshots* [Insert screenshots of your app's UI]
